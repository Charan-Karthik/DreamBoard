# DreamZZZ
A two-in-one private dream journal and social media site to track and share your dreams.

**PROGRESS UPDATE:** As of 11/15/22 @ 11am PST, the site's functionality is nearly complete. Site styling is the last item on the to-do list before the site is fully complete. (Styling progress has been delayed due to prioritization of work on other projects.)
